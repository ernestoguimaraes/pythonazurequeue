# Python Queries Azure Storage Queues

This sample code shows how to interact with Azure Storage Queues on Python, using the https://pypi.org/project/azure-storage-queue package

It implements the following features:

1. Message Processing in Multiple Threads
2. Parallel Thread Control to avoid Server Overload
3. External Configuration File

## How To

1. Install the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Update the  [Keys.py](Keys.py) with your keys


3.  Send multiple messages to Azure Storage Queue and observe the logs

```

## Important note:

When a listener gets a message, itÂ´s become invisible to others about 30 seconds. In case of "Server Full" , the original message will return to the Queue.

When you explicit delete the message, this become unavailable to others.
